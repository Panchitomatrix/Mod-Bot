# Mod-Bot
Discord Moderation Bot.
Hi there random user, Mod Bot (V1) is a awesome, fast, and secure discord bot. 

How does it work?
Random user, to get started with the bot please enter the following. $help
The help command will make a box with commands for you to use. 
For example, lets use the ban command. I will enter this command. $ban @user
It will ban the user in less than a milisecond!

Wow! But how long is the bot hosted for?
I have to be honest here, I have tried different ways for my bot to run 24/7. It just seems to not work. 
But.. If anyone else out there exploring github knows how to make a discord bot run 24/7 then dm/message on discord. 
My discord is Panchitomatrix#2822

What does Mod Bot do?
Lots of stuff, Random user. My bot has moderation commands, fun commands and more which I will be adding soon!

Is it free?
Random user, you make me laugh. Mod Bot is %100 free! If you want to invite right now, or later then please go to this link:
